Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository is a simple chatbot web application built with Flask and Hugging Face Transformers.

## About This Project

This project provides a conversational AI chatbot using the [facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill](https://huggingface.co/facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill) model.  
It features a web UI (leveraging templates from [ibm-developer-skills-network/LLM_application_chatbot](https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/LLM_application_chatbot)) and a Flask backend that handles inference and conversation logic.

---

## Features

- **Conversational Memory:** Maintains context across turns during a session.
- **Modern LLM Backend:** Uses Hugging Face's Blenderbot 400M distilled model for responses.
- **Web Interface:** Clean, simple frontend for chatting with the bot.
- **CORS Enabled:** Backend supports cross-origin requests.
- **Modular:** Easy to swap models or adapt the front-end.
